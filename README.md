> **(1)** SRP : Single Responsibility Principle
>>
>> `A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.`
>
> **(2)** OCP : Open/Closed Principle
>>
>> `Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.`
>> `In doing so, we stop ourselves from modifying existing code and causing potential new bugs.`
>
> **(3)** LSP : Liskov Substitution Principle
>>
>> `if class A is a subtype of class B, then we should be able to replace B with A without disrupting the behavior of the program.`
>
> **(4)** ISP : Interface Segregation Principle
>>
>> `A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn't use.`
>> `Clients shouldn't be forced to depend on methods they do not use.`
>
> **(5)** DIP : Dependency Inversion Principle
>
>> `High level modules should not depend on low level modules; both should depend on abstractions.`
>> `Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend upon abstractions.`
